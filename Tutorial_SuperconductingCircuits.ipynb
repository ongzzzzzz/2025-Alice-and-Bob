    "# ABC of Hamiltonian engineering with superconducting Josephson junctions\n",

    "### The variables $Q$ and $\\Phi$\n",
    "\n",
    "As in the classical network analysis, we can use current ($I$) and voltage ($V$) to describe these circuit elements. However, we are going to use charge ($Q$) and flux ($\\Phi$) variables which are more convenient because they are the natural variables when you quantize a quantum system.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are related to the current and voltage through Coulomb's law and Weber's law:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "### The Josephson junction\n",
    "\n",
    "When two superconductors are brought in close proximity it turns out that Cooper pairs can tunnel through the weak link and form a supercurrent. This effect was ignored until 1960s as it was thought that such event would require simultaneous tunneling of two incoherent electrons which would make the observation unlikely. In 1962 Brian Josephson predicted that Cooper pair tunneling was a coherent event and the resultant supercurrent was in the same order of magnitude as quasiparticle currents. Josephson’s prediction was followed by the experimental proof in 1963 and the Josephson junction became the generic name for weakly coupled superconductors. A plethora of device configurations were shown to display Josephson effect. Here are three examples:\n",
